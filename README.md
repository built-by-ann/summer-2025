# Summer 2025 Project Roadmap ‚Äì Ann Mathew

This summer, I plan to build a diverse portfolio of applied AI and socially impactful tech projects. My work spans sustainability, fairness, infrastructure resilience, and ethical machine learning. Below is a summary of the key initiatives I'll be continuing and hopefully adding to Github soon:

---

## üé£ Illegal Fishing Detector (Final Phase)
Build and deploy a machine learning system that detects illegal fishing activity using satellite-based SAR imagery and AIS data.  
- Finalize data pipeline alignment and preprocessing
- Improve vessel behavior modeling using LSTM or hybrid models  
- Package model outputs into a visual prediction tool
- Prepare documentation and results for publication or open-source release

---

## ‚ö° AI for Grid Failures (Graph Neural Networks)
Create a machine learning tool using GNNs to predict grid failures in power systems.  
- Train on real-world power grid datasets  
- Detect potential points of failure before outages occur  
- Package with a simple UI for use by researchers and utility companies  
- Contribute to energy resilience and smart grid innovation  

---

## üèôÔ∏è Gentrification Early Warning System
Develop a time-series prediction tool for forecasting urban gentrification.  
- Scrape real estate prices and city permit data over time  
- Use Facebook‚Äôs Prophet forecasting model to predict displacement trends  
- Build an interactive dashboard for use by planners, activists, and community organizations  

---

## üö≤ Low Carbon Router
Engineer a navigation tool that minimizes CO‚ÇÇ emissions rather than just distance or time.  
- Extend Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) to support carbon-aware routing  
- Use real-time traffic data and road classifications to optimize routes  
- Deploy for eco-conscious users and urban sustainability initiatives  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Bias Auditor for Machine Learning Models
Build a tool for fairness auditing in predictive algorithms.  
- Analyze datasets (e.g., COMPAS) for bias in outcomes  
- Compute and visualize fairness metrics across demographic groups  
- Provide actionable feedback to reduce model bias and increase transparency  
- Integrate into standard ML pipelines to support ethical AI development

---

## üåê Portfolio Website
Design and publish a professional portfolio website to showcase projects, research, and career goals.  
- Built with Figma for design and React/Tailwind for implementation  
- Highlight technical projects, UX work, and interdisciplinary research  
- Include resume, project spotlights, and prior internship work
